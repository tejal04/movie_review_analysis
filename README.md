# Movie Review Analysis
### This project was done as part of the coursework for CS6120: Natural Language Processing.

### Dataset
1. [IMDb 50k movie reviews dataset released by Stanford](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
2. [Reviews of The Shawshank Redemption scraped from IMDb](../dataset/)

Here is a [3-min summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFz2TGn07qI) of the movie for better understanding of the results.

Two kinds of analysis were performed on the reviews of the movie, [The Shawshank Redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption):

1. ### Sentiment Analysis
  * Traditional supervised ML methods like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and 
  * Deep Learning models like LSTM and RNN
2. ### Topic Modelling
  * LDA with BOW and TFIDF vector representations
  * NMF with BOW and TFIDF vector representations.
  
Code for them can be found in jupyter notebooks inside their respective folders.
